# project

#Problem Statement:
The main goal of this project is to perform extensive Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA) on 
the Zomato Dataset and build an appropriate Machine Learning Model that will help 
various Zomato Restaurants to predict their respective Ratings based on certain 
features.


#Approach: The classical machine learning tasks like Data Exploration, Data Cleaning, 
Feature Engineering, Model Building and Model Testing. Try out different machine 
learning algorithms thatâ€™s best fit for the above case.

#Results: You have to build a solution that should able to predict the ratings of the 
restaurants listed in the dataset.
